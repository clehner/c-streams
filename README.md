# C Streams

An API for streams in C, with a focus on I/O for 68k Mac OS systems.

Currently implements stream providers for files and TCP sockets.

The API is a callback-based event loop that uses minimal polling.

Build using the [Retro68](https://github.com/autc04/Retro68) distribution of
gcc.

Made for use with [Browsy](https://github.com/clehner/Browsy).
